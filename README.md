## Oh, Hi there! 👋

My name is Nat (online) and i am from Indonesia :D

I'm currently learning Python, Java, Kotlin, C++
I am still a beginner, so don't expect much from it :(

Right now I'm making AOSP ROM builds for random device in my freetime if i want to (and if i have the server) xD

Thank you for reading this! :D

See you again later 👋🤗
